# 101Series
This is a repository for all the source code of the 101 Series of booklets for code exercises.

The "101 Series" Booklets are concise, practical programming guides designed for hands-on learning. Each booklet—covering JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and React Native—contains 101 curated exercises with detailed answers. These exercises range from beginner to intermediate levels and focus on real-world coding challenges to reinforce core concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and boost confidence in building modern web and mobile applications.

AS of 08/05/2025 JavaScript 101 is in draft form, its almost ready for production. Comments will always be welcome. Like most people, I'm also learning JavaScript and using AI to generate code. I correct parts of where the code is incomplete. AI is a massive source of programming intellectual property that when used correctly can act as a way for learning to program correctly.
